		<h1>Introduction to C++</h1>
		
		<h2>id="whatc++"What is C++?</h2>
		
		<p>A programming language (be it C++, HTML, Python etc) is a huge group</br>
		of strings that, put together, have as an outcome different functions which are used </br>
		in order to do certain things with the computer.</p>
		
		<p>Each programming language has two main components, which are the <strong>syntax</strong> (or the form)<br>
		and the <strong>semantics</strong> (or the meaning).</p>
		
		<h2> id="Syntax" Syntax</h2>
		
		<p> The syntax itself is a set of "rules" which have to be followed in order to get an error-free output.<br>
		In order to understand it, let's discuss a simple programme, the "hello world!" one:</p>
		
		<p class="c++Ipart"> #include <iostream> </br> using namespace std; </br> int main() <br> </p>
		
		<p>{ </br> cout<<"Hello world! <br> } <br> <br> </p>
		
		<p> The output of this will pe a "hello world!" text shown by the complier <em>(another file which opes automatically<br>
		in case of an error-free programme when you press the "Build&run" button so that you can see the outcome of what<br>
		you tried to do and see whether you wrote the coding part right or not) </em>.</p>\
		<ol>
			
			<li>"#include <iostream>"</li>
		
			<p>This is how we introduce the <iostream> library. It is a really used one, but it is not the only one and, depending on<br>
			the programme that you want to do, you might not need it, as it only comes with some functions. Each library (and there are<br>
			many libraries) comes with its own functions, and only few functions can be found in two or more libraries at the same time.</br>
			But a standard thing is the "#indclude", because it's how to "implement" a new function in the programme. If you use a function<br>
			that is not included in the library, then the complier will show you where the function is used and say that it doesn't recognise it.<br><br>
			
			<li>"using namespace std;"</li>
			<p>In programming, we can't have variables with the same name, so this is why we use namespaces. So for a new namespace we have only one<br>
			value and we can use it whenever we want. This is relatively new in this programming language, but is extremely useful.<br><br></p>
		
			<ol>"int main"</ol>
			<p>Each prohramme needs to have a main function. the int one is the most used, but depening on the type of programme that you want<br>
			to do, you might need to use, for instance, the int, which is also the most recommended in general.</p>
			
			<ol>The { and the }</ol>
			<p>They are used to separate a part of the programme (in general a function) which contains more commands. If a function is called only for<br>
			a command, then you don't have to use { and } if you don't want to. But if you have to write more than a line of code for a function, then you<br>
			have to write those lines inside the the curly braces.</p>
			
			<ol>"cout<<"Hello world!"</ol>
			<p>The important part is the "cout". It is the function used in C++ to get the output on the complier. <strong><em>Standard output stream<br>
			</strong></em> is a basic C++ function that can be found in the <iostream> library. After it, the text that you want to be shown on the<br>
			complier has to be written in " "(quotation marks), so that the computer sees that you want to write something that can't be understood by it<br>
			and that it shouldn't take as a variable.</p>;
		</ol>
		
		<h2> id="Semantics" Semantics</h2>
		<p>This is the part that pits together all the functions and the operations that we do. In order to have an outcome from those lines<br>
		of code that are written, the semantics help to link the together. For instance, when writing a difficult calculus (let's say, 1784+735*63-7353/63+44%6)<br>
		it helps. Of course, this is a simple example, as it can do way more complex things. But what you have to remember is that the semantics is something<br>
		that you don't see, but that tries to make sense and understand what you meant in the programme.</p>
